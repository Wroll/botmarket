Bot deployed on GoogleCloud to ngnix and runned with gunicorn.
Link on bot: @project_market_bot
Note: Sometimes it may seem that the bot does not work after you send a request.
This is a problem with the side of GoogleCloud. To do this,
after sending the request, wait a few seconds and send the request again.
In future, planing comlete admin page (bases on flask) to manage bot DB.
